INTRODUCTION

Telematics is the merging of two tech fields â€’ telecommunications (a branch of technology dealing with long distance
transmission of information by cables, phone lines, etc.) and informatics (the study of computational systems).

Telematics deals with building a network of vehicles and telecommunication devices, 
and as such it falls under the IoT (Internet of Things) umbrella.
